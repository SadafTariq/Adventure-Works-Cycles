This is an Interim project I did during Generation UK&I Bootcamp, where I analysed the database and answered several business problems

- Data is taken from AdventureWorksCycles database
- Utilise SQL, Python, and data analytics skills to uncover key learnings from the dataset
- Utilized visualization skills to support findings and trends in the dataset
- Created a presentation deck and clearly communicated analytical results
- A report was generated to defend the analysis
